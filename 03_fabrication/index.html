<h4>Assignment: Create a Kinetic Sculpture</h4>

Since I am planning to build a zoetrope for my final project, this week's opportunity to build a kinetic 
sculpture presented a good opportunity to prototype the basic mechanism: a spinning drum that displays a
serial sequence of images. Because the zoetrope may require some complexity with strobe effects, I 
chose to build a model of a similar yet simpler device, the [praxinoscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praxinoscope), 
that relies on mirrors instead of light to create an illusion of animation. 

Since the mechanism would be driven by a DC motor with max 5V power from the Arduino (as we learned in class), I chose
to work with carboard to keep everything lightweight, and figured the majority of the geometry could be laser cut and/or
scored and folded to shape.

I began by prototyping the essential elements, a central column of mirrored panels on a rotatable platform. The praxinoscope requires 1 mirror panel per image/frame in the sequence, and I chose an 8 frame design to keep this small.
I scored 8 panels and folded them into an octagonal column, and inserted some reflective mylar sheet that was lying around the lab. Before getting too deep into the image part, I drew out 8 shapes and taped them around the platform to test basic functionality

The design looked promising so I continued on. I chose a sequence of some stock images from Adobe, and cut/scored
another octagonal shape with panels for each image that would align with the panels on the mirrored column. All coardboard pieces were press fit, and I glued on the reflective film and images.

I then needed a way to both connect my scultpure to the motor, and a way to hold both the motor and the sculpture
upright and in place. I fooled around in Rhino for a while and chose a design for a half lap joint base that would
hold a box surrounding the motor while allowing the wires to come down through the bottom.

<p class="caption">Sketches for the motor base, with the final design in green, and then assembled</p>

Lastly, I cut a 1 sq inch piece of plywood that would attach to the motor shaft. I recut the base of the sculpture with the same sized cutout in the center, and an additional "fix plate" that would simply support all pieces of the praxinoscope from underneath.

From there, all I needed to do was hook up the motor to power and let it spin! I soldered wire to the motor's leads, 
and plugged in to the Arduino. 5V ended up spinning the sculpture way too fast, but the 3V pin was perfect. Praxinoscope complete!

P.S, here's what all the geometry needed for this sculpture looks like in a 2D sketch
